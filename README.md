These are various coding excersises that I completed while doing the American computer science League. Not only did I complete
them myself, butI also taught and helped kids solve these problems. These problems range from low level to high level difficulty. These problems are mid teaers, and take some time to grasp. Doing these problems definatley helped my Analytical skills by a lot, and mde me a confident programmer.
